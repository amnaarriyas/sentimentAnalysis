# Sentiment Analysis Tool

This project is a simple sentiment analysis tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of input text. It identifies the positive, negative, or neutral sentiment of the given text and displays the results to the user. The backend is powered by Python and Flask, while the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze text for positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple frontend interface for user input and displaying results.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Results are provided instantly as the user submits text.

## Demo
To use the tool, enter any text in the input box, click **Analyze Sentiment**, and view the sentiment analysis results immediately.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Flask** for the backend
- **nltk** (Natural Language Toolkit) library for sentiment analysis
- **Git** for version control (optional, if you want to clone the repository)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SentimentAnalysis.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SentimentAnalysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Download the **VADER Lexicon** for sentiment analysis:
   ```python
   python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon
   ```

### Run the Application
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. The server will run at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

### Frontend
1. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
2. Enter text in the input box, click **Analyze Sentiment**, and view the results displayed on the page.

└── templates/
    └── index.html          # HTML for user interface
```

## How It Works
1. **Frontend**: Collects input from the user and sends it to the backend.
2. **Backend**: Processes the input text using the VADER Sentiment Analyzer from `nltk` and returns a sentiment score.
3. **Result**: Displays the sentiment analysis result (positive, negative, neutral) to the user.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the user interface for a better experience.
- Improve sentiment analysis accuracy using additional NLP models.
- Add support for analyzing longer texts and more languages.
